    "The first step I took in getting an access key to access the Genius API was to make a Genius account. After I signed up for an account, I followed this link: https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1 to read about how to get started. The first hyperlink on that page took me to the API Client management page, where I was prompted to input an app name, an icon URL, an app website URL, and a redirect URI. Once I saved the fields that I filled out, it gave me my Client ID, my Client Secret, and my Client Access Token."
